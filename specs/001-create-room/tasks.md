# Feature: Room Creation (001-create-room)

## Phase 1: Project Setup

- [x] T001 Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript 5.x strict mode in src/random-with-friends/
- [x] T002 [P] Add ESLint and Prettier configs in src/random-with-friends/.eslintrc.js and .prettierrc
- [x] T003 [P] Configure Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components in src/random-with-friends/
- [x] T004 [P] Set up Pusher environment variables in src/random-with-friends/.env.local
- [x] T005 Install required npm packages (pusher-js, zod, etc.) in src/random-with-friends/package.json

## Phase 2: Foundational Tasks

- [x] T006 Create Pusher client/server setup in src/random-with-friends/lib/pusher.ts
- [x] T007 [P] Create room and participant type validation in src/random-with-friends/lib/schemas.ts
- [x] T008 [P] Add room ID generation utilities in src/random-with-friends/lib/room-utils.ts

## Phase 3: Room Creation (US1)

**Story Goal**: Host can create a room and see participants join
**Test Criteria**: Room creation form works, displays room ID, shows participant list with host indicator

### Implementation Tasks

- [x] T009 [US1] Create room form component in src/random-with-friends/components/create-room-form.tsx
- [x] T010 [P] [US1] Implement room creation API in src/random-with-friends/app/api/rooms/route.ts
- [x] T011 [P] [US1] Set up room page structure in src/random-with-friends/app/room/[roomId]/page.tsx
- [x] T012 [P] [US1] Create participant list component in src/random-with-friends/components/participant-list.tsx
- [x] T013 [US1] Implement Pusher presence channel subscription in src/random-with-friends/app/room/[roomId]/layout.tsx

## Phase 4: Room Joining (US2)

**Story Goal**: Guests can join existing rooms
**Test Criteria**: Join form validates room ID, guest joins successfully, appears in participant list

### Implementation Tasks

- [x] T014 [US2] Create join room form component in src/random-with-friends/components/join-room-form.tsx
- [x] T015 [P] [US2] Add room existence check API in src/random-with-friends/app/api/rooms/[roomId]/exists/route.ts
- [x] T016 [P] [US2] Implement room join validation in src/random-with-friends/lib/room-validation.ts
- [x] T017 [US2] Set up Pusher auth endpoint in src/random-with-friends/app/api/pusher/auth/route.ts

## Phase 5: Connection Handling (US2/US3)

**Story Goal**: Graceful handling of disconnects, reconnects, and host changes
**Test Criteria**: Reconnecting states shown, host changes handled correctly

### Implementation Tasks

[x] T018 [P] Create connection status component in src/random-with-friends/components/room-connection-status.tsx
[x] T019 Implement reconnection handling in participant list component
[x] T020 [P] Add host promotion logic in src/random-with-friends/lib/host-management.ts
[x] T021 [US3] Create host controls component in src/random-with-friends/components/host-controls.tsx
[x] T022 [US3] Implement room closure endpoint in src/random-with-friends/app/api/rooms/[roomId]/close/route.ts

## Phase 6: Tests and Polish

- [x] T023 [P] Create base test utilities in test/e2e/utils/room-helpers.ts
- [x] T024 [P] Add room creation E2E test in test/e2e/room-creation.spec.ts
- [x] T025 [P] Add room joining E2E test in test/e2e/room-joining.spec.ts
- [x] T026 [P] Add host management E2E test in test/e2e/host-management.spec.ts
- [x] T027 Add performance monitoring for success criteria metrics
- [x] T028 Add error boundaries and fallback UI components
- [x] T029 [P] Write deployment documentation in src/random-with-friends/README.md

## Dependencies

1. Phase 1 (Setup) must complete first
2. Phase 2 (Foundation) must complete before any user stories
3. User stories can be implemented in parallel after Phase 2:
   - US1 (Room Creation) and US2 (Room Joining) are independent
   - US3 (Host Management) depends on both US1 and US2

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

Story 1 (Room Creation):

- T009 (Room form) and T010 (API) can be built in parallel
- T011 (Room page) and T012 (Participant list) can be built in parallel

Story 2 (Room Joining):

- T014 (Join form) and T015 (Room check API) can be built in parallel
- T016 (Validation) and T017 (Auth endpoint) can be built in parallel

Tests:

- All E2E tests (T024-T026) can be written in parallel
- Test utilities (T023) must be completed first

## Implementation Strategy

MVP Scope (Story 1 only):

1. Complete Phase 1 and 2 (Setup and Foundation)
2. Implement Story 1 (Room Creation)
3. Add basic E2E test for room creation
4. Validate MVP meets SC-001 and SC-004

Full Implementation:

1. Complete MVP
2. Add Story 2 (Room Joining) in parallel with Story 3 (Host Management)
3. Implement connection handling
4. Add remaining tests and polish
5. Validate all success criteria
