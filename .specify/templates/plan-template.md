# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

Project plans MUST explicitly verify the following constitution gates before Phase 0 can
proceed. Each gate is a yes/no check with an explanation when "no":

- TypeScript First: code targets TypeScript and the plan documents any non-TS components.
- Framework & UI Stack: plan uses Next.js + shadcn + Tailwind OR provides an approved
  justification and migration plan.
- Formatting & Linting: plan confirms Prettier and ESLint configurations and CI checks.
- Realtime/Integration: if realtime is proposed, plan names the library (preferred: pusher-js)
  and documents why an alternative is used.
- Observability/Versioning: plan lists basic logging and versioning expectations for any
  public-facing interfaces or APIs.

- Testing: plan MUST use Playwright for full-app E2E testing of Next.js user journeys, or
  provide an explicit justification why Playwright cannot be used and how equivalent E2E
  coverage will be achieved. Unit/component tests are allowed but are not a substitute for
  Playwright E2E coverage on user-facing features.

Plans that cannot meet these gates MUST include an explicit technical justification and an
approval path via governance before research resources are allocated.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
